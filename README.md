# README

This application, originally prototyped for a software engineering course, will display selected social media feeds and allow users to manage which feeds they see from a pre-selected list. It is intended as an aggregator of feeds for use within institutions like universities (which have a wealth of student organizations), large companies (which maintain social media accounts for local offices), etc.
